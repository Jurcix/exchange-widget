# exchange-widget
This application is UI part of ExchangoPatronum. It allows user to select base and quote currencies and shows the exchange rate and converted amount.

To use this application properly you will need a magic wand to cast a spell "ExchangoPatronum".
Joking, there is no magic involved but you will need to run ExchangoPatronum locally to see appropriate results :)
